# About Jarvis - An Intelligent AI Consciousness ðŸ§ 
Jarvis is a voice commanding assistant service in [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
It can recognize human speech, talk to user and execute basic commands.

#### Assistant Skills 
*   **Opens a web page** (e.g 'Jarvis open youtube')
*   **Play music in Youtube** (e.g 'Jarvis play mozart')

*   **Clear bash console** (e.g 'Jarvis clear console')
*   **Has help command, which prints all the skills with their descriptions** (e.g 'Jarvis help')
*   **Do basic calculations** (e.g 'Jarvis (5 + 6) * 8' or 'Jarvis one plus one')
*   **Change settings on runtime** (e.g 'Jarvis change settings')

#### Assistant Features
*   **Asynchronous command execution & speech recognition and interpretation**

## Getting Started
### Create KEYs for third party APIs
Jarvis assistant uses third party APIs for speech recognition,web information search, weather forecasting etc.
All the following APIs have free no-commercial API calls. Subscribe to the following APIs in order to take FREE access KEYs.
*   [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid): API for weather forecast.
*   [WolframAlpha](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/): API for answer questions.
*   [IPSTACK](https://ipstack.com/signup/free): API for current location.
### Setup Jarvis in Ubuntu/Debian system
*   Download the Jarvis repo localy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggeop/Jarvis.git
```
*   Setup Jarvis and system dependencies:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

*   Put the Keys in settings

**NOTE:** *For better exprerience, before you start the application you can put the free KEYs in the settings.py*

```bash
nano Jarvis/src/jarvis/jarvis/setting.py
```

### Start voice commanding assistant
![alt text](https://github.com/ggeop/Jarvis/blob/master/imgs/Jarvis_printscreen.PNG)

*   Start the assistant service:
```bash
bash run_jarvis.sh
```

### How to add a new Skill to assistant
You can easily add a new skill in two steps.
*   Create a new configurationin SKILLS in **skills/registry.py**
```python
{ 
  'enable': True,
  'func': Skills.new_skill,
  'tags': 'tag1, tag2',
  'description': 'skill description..'
}               
```
*   Create a new skill module in **skills/collection**

### Desicion Model

### Extract skill
The skill extraction implement in a matrix of [TF-IDF features](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) for each skill.
In the following example he have a dimensional space with three skills.
The user input analyzed in this space and by using a similarity metric (e.g cosine) we find the most similar skill.
